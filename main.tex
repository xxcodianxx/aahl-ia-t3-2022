\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Aim}
The aim of this investigation is, using mathematical functions, to model the
vertical oscillation of the human body while walking.

\subsection{Applications}
There are numerous applications of modern technology where being able to model the
oscillation from walking is invaluable. For example, optical image stabilization
present in nearly all modern video cameras aims to minimize the 'screen shake' by 
compensating with movement in the lens of the camera. A model of oscillation while
walking could aid this endeavor by allowing more predictable corrections to be made
by software.
